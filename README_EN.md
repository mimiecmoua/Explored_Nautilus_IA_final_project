## 🧭 Geographic Reconstruction AI

## 🖼️ Examples / Screenshots

Here’s a preview of the interactive map generated by the embedded AI:

This Python script `Map_traduction.py` automatically generates an interactive map of the Nautilus's journey, based on a structured JSON file. It uses Folium for mapping, and includes a semantic AI function to display bilingual information: `make_bilingual_popup(row)`.

Each stop is marked with an interactive icon, and the submarine's full journey is visualized by a continuous line across the map.

➡️ Goal: to blend literary storytelling with geospatial visualization through a lightweight yet evocative AI engine.

# The Nautilus Exploration 🦑

"An immersive interactive map inspired by Jules Verne, powered by AI and modern web technologies."

## 🚀 Overview

I created this project because, as a highly organized woman, I mentally visualized the Nautilus’s journey like a mind map. This intuition led me to extract and structure geographic data from Jules Verne’s _Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas_. 🦑

Using JupyterLab and frameworks like Folium, I developed an application that calculates and displays the coordinates of each Nautilus stop. It's powered by an embedded AI that generates bilingual information popups and traces the submarine's full path on an interactive map.
